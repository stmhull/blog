Gilgo was a terrible wizard. He flunked out of wizard college, went on a bender, spent all his money, and found work using cantrips to entertain the children of nobles at parties. He would invariably frighten or injure a party goer and be chased out of town. On top of being a talentless hack, he was rude, and smelled bad. Even by gnome standards, he was an ugly jerkoff with no friends. None of this discouraged him in his quest to become among the greats: Tenser, Tasha, Melf, Mordekainen, and… GILGO. Without supplies, talent, or know-how, he devoted his life to creating spells. These are the spells he created. In the foreword of his book, Gilgo’s Book of Advanced Arcana, he insists each of them be referred to as “Gilgo’s” etc. He died after being kicked by a beautiful horse off a cliff onto a wagon full of gunpowder.

GILGO’S SUPERIOR POLYMORPH
5th
V, S, M (A bit of raccoon fur mixed with ruby dust)

Duration: 1 hour

1: Large

2-5: Huge

6-10: Gargantuan

GILGO’S ENFORCED PROPERTY RIGHTS

3rd

V, S, M (Numerous iron stakes)
Casting time: 1 hour

Duration: Indefinite

Effects: The caster demarcates the boundaries of their property with the iron stakes. After the spell is cast, a very loud, bright magical boundary appears in the form of 20 ft walls. These walls are opaque, but can be traversed as if they weren’t there. When any living thing, such as a squirrel or an intruder, or nonliving thing, such as a leaf, crosses the boundary, a voice announces their presence and commands them/it to leave.

GILGO’S SUPERIOR ACID ARROW

8th

V, S, M (7 tons of lumber)
Casting time: 24 hours

Range: 10 ft

Effect: Like acid arrow, but 6d6 damage on a successful ranged spell attack.

GILGO’S SUPERIOR HIDEOUS LAUGHTER

1st
V, S, M (A handful of goose down)

Casting time: 1 round

Duration: 1 hour

Range: 30 ft

Effects: Upon failing a wisdom check, the target is afflicted with an ugly laugh. The target brays like a donkey, or some kind of brain-damaged hyena. Their laugh is really stupid. You can mock  them if you want. You should, really. You should make them feel bad.

GILGO’S ADVISING SPIRIT

4th

V, S, M (Gilgo’s favorite food, raw bread dough)

Casting time: 1 minute

Effects: Gilgo himself appears before the caster to offer sage, and timely, advice. ED. NOTE: While Gilgo imagined he would be summoned from the Wizard Plane after his death (a plane that does not exist) he is actually summoned from Limbo. Evidently he’s been summoned to parties of drunk wizards one too many times, because he mainly sits on the ground, facing away from the caster, with his arms crossed, until the spell ends.

GILGO’S COPROPHOBIC AUGURY

5th

V (screaming), S, M (a poop)

Casting time: Instantaneous 

Effects: The caster tosses the poop in the air. If it hits the caster, woe. If it hits someone else, weal. If it hits nobody, neither weal nor woe--the caster can do it again if they’re feeling like a real prick, but this will not change the previous outcome.
